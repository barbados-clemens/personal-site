## Steps

1. Prep

   * Adjust rack to upper position and preheat oven to 450. 
   * Wash and dry all produce. 
   * Peel carrots, then halve lengthwise. Cut into 3 inch long pieces. Dice potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces. Thinly slice chives
2. Cook Potatoes

   * Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch.
   * Bring to a boil.
   * Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. 
   * Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, then drain and return potatoes to pot.
3. Roast Carrots

   * Meanwhile, toss carrots with a drizzle of oil, 1 tsp Fry Seasoning, and a big pinch of salt and pepper on a foil-lined baking sheet.
   * Roast, tossing halfway through, until lightly browned and tender, 15-20 minutes
4. Bread Chicken

   * Combine panko with remaining Fry Seasoning and a big pinch of salt and pepper. 
   * Pat chicken dry with paper towels. 
   * Season all over with salt and pepper. 
   * Brush chicken all over with panko mixture, pressing to adhere.
5. Fry Chicken and Mashed Potatoes

   * Heat a 1/4 inch layer of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until panko is golden brown and meat is cooked through, 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate and set aside.
   * To pot with potatoes, add remaining sour cream, 2 TBSP butter, and half with chives. 
   * Mash, adding reserved cooking water if needed, until creamy and smooth
6. Plate and Serve

   * Divide chicken, carrots, and potatoes between plates. 
   * Drizzle hot honey over chicken.
   * Sprinkle remaining chives onto potatoes
