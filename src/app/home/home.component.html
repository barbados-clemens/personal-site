  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Caleb</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer, technology enthusiast, and simply enjoy learning new things.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been a professional software developer since 2017, right before
    starting my career, I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.
    I've been a problem solver for as long as I can remember, and I am
    always trying to find new things to learn.
