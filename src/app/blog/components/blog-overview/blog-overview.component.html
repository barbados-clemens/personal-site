<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>I try to write at least once a month. What I write can vary but typically related to whatever I've been hacking on,
  experimenting with, or just enjoying in my spare time.</p>

<p>
  Most of my posts aim at being documentation for myself so I can remember how I did something before. Because they
  serve this purpose, the posts aren't full of <em>foo, bar, baz</em> type examples. Typically a runnable code snippets
  or repo links will be provided.
</p>

<p>
  Down below are a few posts, but you can search <a href="/blog#search">down below</a> if you can't find what you're looking for.

  href="/contact">contact form</a> if you need help, want to get in touch, or just want to say how awesome I am. I won't
  stop you ðŸ˜‰.
